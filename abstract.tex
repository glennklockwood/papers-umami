I/O efficiency is essential to productivity in scientific computing, especially as many scientific domains become more data-intensive.
Many characterization tools have been used to elucidate specific aspects of parallel I/O performance, but
analyzing individual component of complex I/O subsystems in isolation fails to provide insight into critical questions:
how do the I/O components interact,
what are reasonable expectations for application performance, and what are the underlying causes and effects of I/O performance problems?
% These questions suggest the need for a unified, comprehensive, multi-level, system-wide I/O characterization tool, but such an effort would fail to capitalize on existing proven component-level characterization tools, and it would not be portable across facilities with diverse computing and storage vendors.
To address these questions while capitalizing on existing component-level characterization tools,
we propose an approach using on-demand, modular synthesis of \emph{existing} I/O characterization data sources into a unified monitoring and metrics interface (UMAMI) that provides a normalized, coherent, holistic view of I/O behavior. 


In this work, we evaluate the feasibility of this integrative approach by applying it to a month-long benchmarking study conducted on on two distinct large-scale computing platforms.
We present three case studies which highlight the importance of analyzing application I/O performance in context with both contemporaneous and historical component metrics, and we provide new generalizable insights into the multiple factors that can affect I/O performance.
%The case studies also reveal the challenges of portable data integration and the potential impact of applying these techniques to production workloads.

% I/O efficiency is essential to productivity in scientific computing,
% especially as many scientific domains become more data-intensive.
% A variety of characterization tools have been used to elucidate and optimize specific aspects of parallel I/O.
% However, analyzing individual component of the I/O subsystem in isolation fails to provide insight into the most important questions:
% how do the I/O components interact,
% what are reasonable expectations for application performance,
% and what are the underlying causes and effects of I/O performance problems?

% In this work we present the results of holistic I/O characterization that integrates I/O instrumentation data from multiple sources to provide novel insight into performance.
% We incorporate data from file system instrumentation, application instrumentation, and health monitoring on two distinct, large-scale computing platforms and 
% use periodic regression benchmarking to convert disparate sources of data into knowledge about system-level performance variation.
% We then present three case studies that highlight how this holistic approach can be used to understand abnormal I/O performance in increasingly complex storage systems.
