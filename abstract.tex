% As scientific computing becomes more data-intensive and storage hierarchies
% deepen, I/O performance is becoming increasingly critical to productivity in
% HPC.  Instrumentation and analysis tools have long been used to understand
% parallel I/O performance, but analyzing the individual components of I/O
% subsystems in isolation fails to answer how these components interact and
% result in poor I/O performance.
%
% To this end, we have developed a framework for holistic I/O characterization
% that integrates instrumentation from file system servers, applications, file
% system health monitors, and other system resources.  Along with formalized
% periodic regression benchmarking, we then demonstrate this framework's
% portability and unobtrusiveness by deploying it in production on two
% leadership-class computing platforms.  Using data collected during a month
% long study, we provide unique insights into applications' I/O performance
% that are enabled by this approach.  We then extend these findings to provide
% a broader understanding of how application performance varies across
% different file systems and workloads.

I/O efficiency is essential to productivity in scientific computing,
especially as many scientific domains become more data-intensive.
A variety of characterization tools have been used to elucidate and optimize specific aspects of parallel I/O.
However, analyzing individual component of the I/O subsystem in isolation fails to provide insight into the most important questions:
how do the I/O components interact,
what are reasonable expectations for application performance,
and what are the underlying causes and effects of I/O performance problems?

In this work we present the results of holistic I/O characterization that integrates I/O instrumentation data from multiple sources to provide novel insight into performance.
We incorporate data from file system instrumentation, application instrumentation, and health monitoring on two distinct, large-scale computing platforms and 
use periodic regression benchmarking to convert disparate sources of data into knowledge about system-level performance variation.
We then present three case studies that highlight how this holistic approach can be used to understand abnormal I/O performance in increasingly complex storage systems.
