\subsection{Computational Results Analysis} \label{sec:appendix/analysis}

Some types of additional diagnostics could be:
\begin{enumerate}
\item validation of the timers (time something with a known execution time, determine the precision and statistical variability of the timer).
\item Confirm results for a manufactured solution.
\item Test the analytics of the problem, e.g., generate a problem with known spectral properties and test its behavior.
\end{enumerate}
