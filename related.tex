Several recent studies have explored how to combine and analyze multiple sources of I/O monitoring information.
Kunkel et al. developed SIOX~\cite{Kunkel:2014:SAC:2769884.2769901} to aggregate information from multiple components of the I/O stack, 
% into a global database with plugins for automatic optimization.
but its reliance on instrumented versions of application libraries to collect metrics makes production deployment challenging.
% Agelastos et al. developed the Lightweight Distributed Metric Service (LDMS)~\cite{7013000} for scalable collection of compute node metrics which could be a data source for similar multicomponent analysis.
%.  The LDMS metrics include client-side I/O counters that could be integrated into TOKIO.
Liu et al. developed AID~\cite{Liu2016} to perform detailed analysis to server-side I/O logs to deduce application-level I/O patterns and make scheduling recommendations.  The clustering approach implemented by AID may be transferable to identifying I/O motifs suitable for generating UMAMI diagrams procedurally.

Other recent studies have explored how to quantify and combat various types of I/O performance variation.
Lofstead et al. observed that variability can be caused by both external interference and internal interference within an application~\cite{Lofstead2010}, and they proposed an adaptive strategy that coordinates I/O activity within an application.
Similarly, Dorier et al. proposed a middleware mechanism for coordinating I/O activity across applications to manage such external interference~\cite{dorier2014calciom}.
Yildiz et al.'s systematic study of I/O interference in a controlled testbed environment found that poor flow control in the I/O path~\cite{Yildiz2016} also contributes to I/O variance, indicating that network-related metrics would be a valuable addition to future work.
Carns et al. reported I/O performance variability for seven frequently repeated production jobs during a two month study~\cite{carns2011understanding} and, similar to our findings, suggested that some access patterns are more susceptible to variability that others.
