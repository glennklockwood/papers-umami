% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.
%
\usepackage{setspace}
\usepackage{wrapfig}
%\usepackage[usenames, dvipsnames]{color}
\usepackage{balance}
\usepackage{mathtools}
\usepackage{multirow}

%\usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
\usepackage{graphicx}
% declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
\graphicspath{{./}{./figs}}
% and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
% every instance of \includegraphics
\DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}

% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% \usepackage{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.

%\usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%\usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/

% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.

% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

% 
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item \textcolor{red}{ALL}: Begin analyzing TOKIO-ABC benchmark results and
%     and think about how we want to correlate this with GPFS/Lustre monitoring
%     data. Are there specific jobs or timeframes that we want to zoom in on
%     to better understand anomalous behavior? Are there I/O trends that we
%     can observe on specific systems or even across systems that would be
%     interesting to the reader? This is where we want to showcase the utility
%     of this framework, so we will need to find something interesting to demonstrate
%     here to convince the reader. 
% 
%     \item \textcolor{red}{ALL}: begin filling in paper intro, background,
%     methodology, system/benchmark descriptions, results, etc.
% 
%     \item \textcolor{red}{SHANE}: round up MMPMON data for a 2-week period
%     of TOKIO-ABC runs on Mira.
% 
%     \item \textcolor{red}{GLENN}: round up LMT data for a 2-week period of
%     TOKIO-ABC runs on Edison.
% 
%     \item \textcolor{red}{WILLIAM}: look at MMPMON data to determine how
%     IOMiner can be extended to analyze GPFS data.
